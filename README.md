# Point-and-Figure

Point-and-Figure is an indicator for MetaTrader 5 by EarnForex.com. It is based on real ticks data that can be downloaded from your broker's MT5 server. The indicator downloads the data for the given time range and plots the P&F chart according to your parameters. It then keeps updating the chart in real-time as new ticks arrive. This indicator supports all types of alerts.

The Point-and-Figure indicator draws its X/O objects in the main chart window, not in the separate window (like some other PnF indicators do).
